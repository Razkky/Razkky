# Hello, I'm Muhammad Jamiu Abdul-Razak 👋

## Software Engineer | Security Researcher
I’m a Backend Engineer focused on building scalable, reliable systems and solving real-world problems with technology.

I work primarily with Python and backend systems, and over the years I’ve gained hands-on experience across different domains, shaping how I approach system design, performance, and maintainability.

I’ve worked as a Backend Engineer at Qudra IO and Eonsfleet Inc, collaborating with cross-functional teams to build impactful products. My experience includes developing APIs, real-time systems, and backend services for features like live session management, chat, feeds, fleet management, fuel automation, geofencing, and maintenance scheduling.

Recently, I’ve been exploring blockchain and Web3, building smart contracts with Solidity and diving into smart contract security, which has expanded how I think about trust and security at scale.

I’m currently the Backend Engineering Lead at Qudra IO, where I combine hands-on engineering with leadership, mentoring engineers, contributing to architecture, and ensuring we build scalable and reliable systems.

I’m passionate about continuous learning, collaboration, and building software that makes a real impact. Always open to connecting with fellow engineers and tech enthusiasts.
